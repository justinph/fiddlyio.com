	"overview" =>
	"The site uses what was then known as DHTML and might now be categorized as Web 2.0 to pull off the smooth animations without the use of flash. The back-end is a custom php solution that simply generates the folder listings based on files in directories. Bob was provided with an instruction / spec sheet upon project completion that tells him how to update the images.",

	"I coded all aspects of the site, though the DHTML library was borrowed from elsewhere. Bob came to me with a pretty good idea of what he wanted the site to look like. I helped work the navigation and interaction out."
